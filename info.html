            <h1>When And Where Was The Great Emu War</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The Great Emu War was in 1932 Australia was limping through the great depression, which impacted everyone.</li>
                <li>It was after World War I, so everyone except the US was recovering from the war</li>
                <li>The war was of course in Australia.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>How Did The Great Emu War Start</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>A horde of 20,000 emus were trampling fences and feeding on wheat (one of their favorite foods) while heading over to an area with water.</li>
                <li>Farmers couldn’t defend their farms against the emu horde.</li>
                <li>Authorities called in the army.</li>
                <li>Defence Minister George Pearce agreed to send Lewis machine guns with soldiers to use them against the emus.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>What Are Some Solutions That The Austalians Took to Stop The Emus</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The Australians took the obvious route, population control, or killing the emus with lewis guns.</li>
                <li>They killed a few emus before their guns jammed and the emus scattered</li>
                <li>A week and a half later they opened fire again killing about 1000 emus, ~10 rounds a kill</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Conclusion of the War</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The Emu War resulted in the emus winning, “With the emus smarter -and faster- than the soldiers had anticipated”</li>
                <li>“If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds, it would face any army in the world. They could face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks.” says Major G.P.W. Meredith.</li>
                <li>The Australians couldn’t attack the emus anymore because the federal government refused to let them, the Australians lost.</li>
